### Bugs:

*   Rename files issue causing duplicate selected files ✅
    
*   Folder view should not have a Editor view, or the Editor view should be functional to rename a folder ✅

*   Deleting files should automatically update the folder view ✅
    
*   Renaming files in tree view should update the folder view ✅
