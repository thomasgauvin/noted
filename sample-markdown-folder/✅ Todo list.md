### Bugs:

*   Rename files issue causing duplicate selected files ✅
    
*   Folder view should not have a Editor view, or the Editor view should be functional to rename a folder ✅
    
*   Easier way to go from title to text. Maybe enter should go to text, or tab. ✅
    
*   Deleting files should automatically update the folder view ✅
    
*   Renaming files in tree view should update the folder view ✅
    
*   Renaming a folder does not update the folder directory when in a note within the folder ✅
    
*   Deleting an empty top level folder caused an error ✅
    
*   Renaming files should not be supported in the file tree viewer, or should but currently isn't working ✅
    
*   Add new folder/new file to tree viewer ✅
    
*   Make it so that you can start editing and save later (maybe make it a zip on unsupported devices)
    
*   Make it mobile UI responsive <-- 🟡⬅️
    
*   After entering the title, click enter, and then it deselects, kinda annoying (upon note creation)
